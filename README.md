# Operating Systems Projects  

This repository showcases the projects I developed during my Operating Systems (OS) course in 2023. Each project demonstrates foundational concepts and practical implementations of OS principles.

## Projects  

### 1. **Mini Shell**  
A simple command-line shell for Linux with the following features:  
- Execute commands with arguments.  
- Command chaining (`;`), piping (`|`), and output redirection (`>`).  
- Support for background processes (`&`) and local variable declarations.  

### 2. **Multithreaded Task Handler**  
A system for managing and executing multiple tasks concurrently, utilizing:  
- **Shared Memory**: Efficient communication between threads.  
- **Multithreading**: Optimized task execution using pthreads.  
- **Mutex Locks**: Ensuring thread-safe operations on shared resources.  

### 3. **RAM Simulator**  
A program that simulates memory management operations:  
- Memory allocation and deallocation.  
- Page replacement strategies (e.g., FIFO, LRU).  
- Visualization of memory state during execution.  

### 4. **Linux File System Simulator**  
A simulated Linux-like file system with support for:  
- Creating and managing files and directories.  
- File reading and writing operations.  
- Simulating permissions and metadata storage.
